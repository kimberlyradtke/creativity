    <h1 id="top_h1">Creative Process</h1>
    <p class="process_text">When I am presented with a design problem, I first make sure that I understand what exactly is being asked of me. What am I trying to accomplish? Next I start to sketch out all of my ideas. I work to refine those sketches until I get something that I like. After I get some sketches, I start to put it onto the computer. The sketched ideas are refined at this point and I work and work until I come up with a final product.    </p>
	<h1>Future Improvements</h1>   
    <p class="process_text">In the past, I never sketched out my designs. I would always visual something and then go straight to the program to start my creation. Now, I have gotten into the habit of sketching out some ideas first. I can't believe how much it helps me. It gives me a visual ahead of time. I feel like I am saving a lot of time now, because I can see my design concept ahead of time instead of designing and finding out that it does not work in the end. I would like to continue to sketch more in the future. Another step that I would like to add into my creative process is to create wire-frames. I think this would help to visual space better and how everything is going to fit together without having to worry about the aesthetics.</p>
    <h1>Creative Goals</h1>
    <p class="process_text">My creative goals include broadening my artistic background through classes and practice, training myself to think outside of the box, and becoming more technical in web design.</p>
