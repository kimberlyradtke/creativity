<h1 class="inspiration_h1">Inspiration From Creative Capital</h1>
<h2 class="inspiration_links"><a class="inspiration_links" href="http://creative-capital.org/">Creative Capital</a></h2>
<p class="inspiration_text">Creative-capital.org's bright colors of blue, green, pink and orange against a black background originally caught my eye. Once I clicked on the site my eye was instantly drawn the the use of pops of color mixed in with white. The contrast against the black background was tastefully done. There is great use of color without being overwhelming.</p>
<p class="inspiration_text">When I looked closer, I noticed little snippets of images. When I hovered over the image, I noticed that the complete image appears and the colors are toned down. I thought this was a nice touch, because the image looked like it still fit into the dark background.</p>
<p class="inspiration_text">When looking at the homepage, my eye instantly gravitated to the middle-left of the screen where the logo and brief description reside. I thought they did a very good job at making their name the focal point of the website. Their navigation menu is also clean and unique and has drop down menus for additional information.</p>
<p class="inspiration_text">The thing I liked most was that the secondary pages switched to a white background and slightly different layout while keeping some of the same elements from the homepage for continuity. Overall I thought this website had a great layout and vibe. It has a little bit of a quirky edge, but is very organized and defined. Those are two styles that I hope to be able to mix together seamlessly one day.</p>
